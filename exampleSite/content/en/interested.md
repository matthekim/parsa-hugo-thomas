Our portfolio is limited, selective, passionate, … as we want to partner with personalities who are authentic founders.   
Of course we love ideas (we are all dreamers) but we care more about conversations & converting ideas into an actual healthy business instead of hypergrowth.

Sectors we’ve invested in:  
SaaS, RegTech, B2B, Direct to Consumer, Food, Entertainment.
