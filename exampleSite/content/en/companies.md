We won’t try to flip your business, lock you into complex deal terms. We keep things dead simple. We co-create tangible business results while sharing risks & rewards.

The companies we invest in and partner with usually fall into four buckets:

* We typically look for the ambitious founder(s) who want to co-create;
* We like simple (internet) businesses that have healthy margins, don’t require  tons of people or complex technology and have a competitive edge;
* We look at opportunities with a simple business model that can become a  strong brand, create a loyal community, a nice vertical, or something similar;
* We invest in people with a positive mind, skin in the game and ethical  approach. No assholes or brilliant jerks.

Once we’re both convinced a collaboration will leverage your concept towards a bigger and better outcome, we can agree on a partnership.

If you're concerned your idea or business doesn't fit, feel free to send it to us anyway. We'll take a look and let you know within a couple of days if it's a fit. Sound like a plan? Get in touch.
