We are Next Ventures, an independent strategic venture studio based in Antwerp that supports entrepreneurs and managers chart the course for future growth ambitions.

We believe that supporting unconventional minds is key to crafting a better next.

That’s why we prefer to partner up with ambitious entrepreneurs and small companies (with mvp, traction, founding team) and help them move forward with their business. We embrace co-creation and offer different kinds of investments in return for participation.

On the other hand, we also turn our own ideas into future products, services and brands.

## INTERESTED CO-INVESTING WITH US?

We aren’t your typical venture capital partner, but get in touch and let us know how you think you can bring value to the founders and their ventures. We’re generally not accepting money, but smart money; meaning we expect our co-investors to also contribute expert knowledge.
